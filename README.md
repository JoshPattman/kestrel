# Kestrel - A 3D printable 1:14th RC car

![cover image](assets/kestrel.jpg)
 
This is the repo for the design files for my 3D printable RC buggy, the Kestrel. The primary goal was to make the Kestrel fun to drive in a lot of situations, so it is not particularly good for racing, bashing, or drifting, but it can do a bit of each. I also wanted to design the Kestrel to be smaller than many other 3D printed buggies, so it is roughly 1:14 scale. Here are some of the features:
- Rear-wheel drive using a belt
- No differential (this enables the car to be simpler and more robust)
- Uses oil-filled adjustable shocks
- Fits rubber tyres
- Can be used with TPU drive axles for higher durability

## Parts List
Here are the parts that you need to build this car:

### Materials
- ~500g of filament - I used ESUN PLA+ for every part of the print
- 12x `6700-2RS` bearings
- 4x 60mm RC car shocks - Ensure that both ends of the shock have an open hole and not a ball joint
- 4x RC car tyres - I used 1:10 touring car tyres which can be found [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0BHDSPXZH/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A1N8E4Q081571L&psc=1). If you want to use different tyres it should be straightforward to modify the wheel file to fit them.
- 6mm wide 2GT/GT2 circular belt with a length of about 170mm - I have successfully used a belt that I spliced to the correct size.
- Sticky velcro
- Some sort of grease to reduce friction between 3d printed gears - I am using bike grease
- A set of M3 bolts and nuts of varying lengths
- Superglue/Glue gun

### Electronics
- `MG90S` servo
- `EMAX 2213` motor
- 2S/3S LiPo battery - I am using 3S
- ESC
- Receiver
- Gyro (Optional) - I have found that due to the locked diff, the car really likes to spin out. I am also not a very good driver though, so you might not need this.

## Build instructions
I am working on making a video showing how to build the car. I will link it here when I am done.

## CAD
For this project I am using [FreeCAD Link Branch 2023-01-31](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases/tag/2023.01.31-edge). You can try it out with a different version of FreeCAD, but it may break.
